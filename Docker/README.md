# Dockerfile for Nanoseq custom code

- For maintainability and readability, this Dockerfile has been limited to strict dependencies of NanoSeq custom code & external tools used alongside custom code. Where possible it eliminates the need for external build scripts found in the original project.

- The image is available on the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/NBISweden/NanoSeq/pkgs/container/nanoseq-src), and is pulled automatically by Apptainer during pipeline execution
