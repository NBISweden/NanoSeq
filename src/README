# bamaddreadbundles

Input BAMs are pre-annotated with od, rc, mc, rb, mb, ms, MQ, MC auxiliary tags
by biobambam2 bamsormadup using option rcsupport=1 and bammarkduplicatesopt.


**Filter**
Filters reads if:
  read does not map to an autosome
  non-properly paired
  supplementary
  QC fail
  unmapped
  secondary alignment
  optical duplicate
  reads must have rc, mc, rb and mb tags


**Annotate**
Annotate reads with a read-bundle (RB) auxiliary tag. The RB tag is a comma
delimited list. 

RB if read is in the forward orientation:
  rname
  min(rc, mc)
  max(rc, mc)
  strand (0 = forward, 1 = reverse)
  rb
  mb

RB if read is in the reverse orientation:
  rname
  min(rc, mc)
  max(rc, mc)
  strand (0 = forward, 1 = reverse)
  mb
  rb


**Remove auxiliary tags**
mc, rc, mb, rb, od, ms, MQ, MC
